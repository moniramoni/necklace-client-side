# About necklace
- MISSION: The mission of the necklace is to put hospitality services on the highest level in order to satisfy the demands and expectations of guests. Our aim is to make the Hotel Grand a place for encounters, business success, pleasant meetings and gala ceremonies.


- GOALS : Goals are those activities and standards and organisation must successfully perform or achieve to effectively carry out its missions. A Goal is more specific than a mission; it requires a certain level of achievement that can be observed and measured.
- Measurable goals encourage hotel employees to perform effectively while enabling management to monitor employee progress. Management can determine whether goals are being achieved or whether corrective action is necessary.
